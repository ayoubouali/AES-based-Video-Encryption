# AES-based-Video-Encryption
<br> The purpose of this project was to explore, design, and optimize a cryptographic system implementing the AES-128 algorithm using the Terasic DE10 Standard Board. Where our major concern as engineers was minimizing the execution time that the system takes to correctly encrypt or decrypt data. In addition, implement a real-time video recording and encrypting application.
